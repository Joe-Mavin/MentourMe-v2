# Video Call Architecture Cleanup - October 10, 2025

## Problem Identified
The video call system had multiple conflicting implementations causing camera permission issues and inconsistent behavior:

### Removed Files (Archived for Reference)
1. **MentorshipVideoCall.jsx** - Duplicate video call component with inline WebRTC
2. **webrtcService.js** - Unused WebRTC service implementation

### Kept Files (Unified Solution)
1. **VideoCall.jsx** - Single video call component for all scenarios
2. **simpleWebRTC.js** - Unified WebRTC service with all fixes applied
3. **webrtcConfig.js** - Configuration service (still needed)

### Route Consolidation
- `/video-call/:callId` → VideoCall.jsx (primary route)
- `/mentorship-video-call/:callId` → VideoCall.jsx (unified route)
- `/call/:callId` → VideoCall.jsx (legacy route)

### Key Fixes Applied to simpleWebRTC.js
1. Enhanced media fallback with `ensureLocalMedia()`
2. Improved timing for participant media setup (1.5s delay)
3. Better error handling and state management
4. Comprehensive logging for debugging
5. Race condition prevention with semaphore locks

## Expected Results
- ✅ Single, consistent video call experience
- ✅ No more camera permission issues
- ✅ Both participants see each other properly
- ✅ Cleaner, maintainable codebase
- ✅ No WebRTC service conflicts

## Files Moved to Archive
If needed for reference, the old implementations were:
- `pages/MentorshipVideoCall.jsx` (had its own WebRTC implementation)
- `services/webrtcService.js` (unused alternative WebRTC service)
